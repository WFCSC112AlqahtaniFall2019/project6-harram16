The purpose of this project was to test the difference between sorting through the method of insertion sort.
The results suggested that vectors with the insertion sort are more efficient if the number of elements exceeds around elements.
The time for a linked lists when sorting grew exponentially as the number of values in the vector grew beyond around 1000.
The time for the linked list sorting grew constant compared to linked list with the number of nodes in the linked list.
This is probably due to the way the sorting algorithm works for linked list it takes more time to correctly place the sorted values.
Meanwhile for vectors it accesses random locations easier. For this type of sort specifically, vectors are more efficient.
